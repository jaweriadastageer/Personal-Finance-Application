# What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in developing interactive web applications using Streamlit. I strengthened my skills in Python for data manipulation with Pandas, data visualization with Altair, and integrating backend functionality for transaction management. I also learned to implement financial calculations, goal evaluation logic, and insights generation, while focusing on user-friendly UI/UX design and modular, maintainable code structure. This project enhanced my understanding of combining programming, data analysis, and design to build practical, real-world applications.
